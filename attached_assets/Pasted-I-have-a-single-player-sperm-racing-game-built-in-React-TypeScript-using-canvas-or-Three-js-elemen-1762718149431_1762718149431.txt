I have a single-player sperm racing game built in React + TypeScript using canvas or Three.js elements. I want to upgrade it into a multiplayer meme-style racing game that’s visually polished, funny, and energetic — perfect for a hackathon demo.

Make these improvements and additions:

1. Multiplayer Feature (Core Addition)
	•	Add real-time multiplayer support using Socket.IO (server + client).
	•	Allow up to 3 players to join the same race lobby via a room code or “Join Race” button.
	•	Each player controls their own sperm using keyboard input (WASD or arrow keys).
	•	Show player names or funny nicknames (e.g., “Speedy Gene,” “Lazy Cell,” “Turbo Tadpole”).
	•	Sync all player positions in real time and display them on the same race track.
	•	Add a live leaderboard that updates continuously based on each player’s progress.
	•	The first sperm to reach the egg triggers the “Winner Celebration” screen for all players with confetti animation and funny announcer comments.

2. Gameplay and Camera Fixes
	•	Fix the orientation: sperms should swim upward naturally with a clean, cartoonish design.
	•	Keep the main player visible at the lower part of the screen, with the entire sperm body (head + tail) visible at all times.
	•	Smooth camera follow effect for the local player.

3. Visual and Audio Polish
	•	Add realistic-looking but safe power-ups and obstacles (energy boosts, barriers, power pills). Use high-quality textures, dynamic lighting, and 3D shading for a lively effect.
	•	Add glow trails, motion blur, and particle effects when collecting boosts.
	•	Introduce a fun “boom” or “whoosh” sound whenever the sperm gains speed or activates a boost.
	•	Add upbeat background music that loops during gameplay.

4. Funny Commentary System
	•	Add Text-to-Speech commentary using the Web Speech API that randomly plays sarcastic or funny lines every few seconds, such as:
	•	“Some serious DNA dedication there!”
	•	“This one’s clearly been to the gym!”
	•	“Boost activated! Somebody’s got strong genes!”
	•	Make the announcer more excited when the race gets close to the finish line.
